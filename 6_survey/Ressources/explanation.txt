The vulnerability is on the survey page
While inspecting the HTML, you can see that values are chosen with a select and options from 1 to 10
Just change one of the values (put something like 42), and pick it in the survey
that allow you to change the value sent. After that, the flag will appear

how to correct: - check the value receive from the request
                - get the value from the selected option out of the user's view
