The vulnerability is about the feedback page
If you try to put an empty name, you'll get an error message, saying that the name can't be empty (the function checking that can be found in a script on the HTML)
But if you watch the console, you'll also see an error saying that the function checkForm doesn't exist
This function is not that same as the one  witch check if field is empty, so the content of the field is maybe not well checked
If we try to write something like alert or scrit in the name or message section, you'll get the flag

how to correct: - check and sanitize the value receive from the form
