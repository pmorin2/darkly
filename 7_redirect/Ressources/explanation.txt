The vulnerability is about the redirection on the home page
While inspecting the Facebook, twitter or instagram redirection, you can see that it redirect to:
http://{YOUR IP}/index.php?page=redirect&site={facebook or twitter or instagram}

If we try something else, instead of a social network, we'll get the flag:
http://{YOUR IP}/index.php?page=redirect&site=hacked

how to correct: - check and sanitize the value receive from the request
