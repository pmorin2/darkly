The vulnerability is on the recover page
When you inspect the HTML, there is an hidden input for the mail witch we will get the password
Just change the value to the one you want the password, and submit.


how to correct: - send the request value in an other way, not in an hidden input, but in something the user can't access
                - you can also only retrieve the mail in the back, not in the front
