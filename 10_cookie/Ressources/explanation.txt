The vulnerability is about the cookie on the home page
If you examine the cookies (for example using EditThisCookie), you can see that there is one called I_am_admin with the value:
68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327 : When decrypting it in md5, it means false
So if you change this cookie, replacing false by true in md5 (b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09), an alert will show you the flag

how to correct: - Don't put important information in cookies
                - At least, crypt it with a better algorithm, and don't use true or false value (check it in the back if necessary)
